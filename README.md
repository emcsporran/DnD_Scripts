# Treasure_Randomizer

Trying to make a script that randomizes the treasure tables based on the Wizards of the Coast's, Dungeons and Dragons, Dungeon Master's Guide Sample Treasure Tables.


The reasoning is that depending on the level of the character and the challange of the encounter they have completed there should be a corresponding amount in their reward. Hoever the reward should contain a certain amount of randomization, to ensure they do not obtain the same reward, this is especially important for  lower level charachters as their compat encounters tend to be fairly similar in terms of overall challange.


## Information

The code will be made in Java and Python to practice and extend my Object Oriented skills and my basic Python programming.


## Future Goals

Eventually want to use my knowledge of GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make a stand alone application to run this program. That way it can be in the background of a Dungeon Master's laptop while running a Dungeons and Dragons session.
