# PYTHON_FILE.md
This file lays out the information being used to organize the 
Python files.

## Style Guide
The style guide being used is [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

I am also describing how I will setup the format of the code to make 
it easier to duplicate/template.

## Imports 
Imports should be on seperate lines, unless unique things are being
imported from one package.
